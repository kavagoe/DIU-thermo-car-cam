THIS GUIDE IS ONLY REQUIRED, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE FIRMWARE ON YOUR OWN!
If you just want to flash the newest version of the firmware to your device, follow the Firmware Update Guide in the Document section and use one of the pre-compiled versions (*.hex).


Download and install the following programs:

1. Arduino 1.8.1:                      https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. Teensyduino 1.36:                   https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html
3. Visual Studio 2015/2017 Community:  https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx
4. Visual Micro:                       http://www.visualmicro.com/page/Arduino-Visual-Studio-Downloads.aspx

Now Start Visual Studio.

Go to Tools -> VisualMicro -> Configure Ide Locations. 
Set the ide folder location of your Arduino installation (f.ex. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino") and the optional sketchbook location to this project (f.ex. "C:\Dev\VisualMicro\DIY-Thermocam\").

In the "vMicro" menu, select the following settings:

For DIY-Thermocam V1:
IDE: Arduino 1.6; 
Board: Teensy 3.1/3.2; 
Option1: USB Type: Serial; 
Option2: CPU Speed 144MHz;
Option3: Optimize: Faster

For DIY-Thermocam V2:
IDE: Arduino 1.6; 
Board: Teensy 3.6; 
Option1: USB Type: Serial; 
Option2: CPU Speed 240MHz;
Option3: Optimize: Fastest

Finally, select the right Comport from the list. 
If there is no Comport, upload a blank sketch with the USB Type "Serial" to the Arduino first over the Arduino IDE.

Open the project with Open -> Arduino Project and select the "DIY-Thermocam.ino". 

Compile the project with F7. The last step is to include the Mass Storage into the Hex file.

Copy the output hex "DIY-Thermocam.ino.hex" from Visual studio into the folder "MSD" and start the file "Unify.bat". A new file called "Firmware.hex" will be created.

Upload this file to your DIY-Thermocam with the teensy.exe uploader together with the teensy_reboot.exe from the "MSD" folder.
